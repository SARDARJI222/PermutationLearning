# Cracking the Code: How Permutation Learning Solved a 6x6 JigsawÂ Puzzle
The objective was to train machine learning models to solve 6x6 puzzles in two categories: Landmarks and Faces. The task involves predicting the correct permutation of pieces for each puzzle, based on the given correct permutations. The predictions must be made for the testing set of both categories and concatenated into a single CSV file. In addition, the predictions must be converted into a valid submission format.
